# Dr Pepper 12 pack; missing carbonation 

On 22 Jan, 2022 I purchased 3 12 packs from a Wallgreens near my house. The first 12 pack seemed to be fine, or at least I did not notice an issues. 

However the second one had at least 4 cans that did not seem to have the correct or sufficient amount of carbonation. The cans had some give when squeezed and the soda inside tasted flat, like it had been left open for a day or so. I have 5 cans left of that pack; some of them seem less carbonated than others. 

The third 12 pack I have not opened any of the cans but the first one I inspected did seem to be "not full" and had some give even though it was unopened. I suspect at least that can has the same carbonation issue as the 4 cans from the other pack. 

## Photos

Included in this repository are photos of all six sides of the box of the 12 pack with 4 faulty, in my opinion, cans. I was unable to locate an expiration date on any side; but I am open to someone else finding what I missed. The seventh image is a close up of the bar code on one of the long sides.
